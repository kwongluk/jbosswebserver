Install the Certificate File in Your Keystore

Important: You must install the SSL/TLS Certificate file to the same keystore and under the same alias name (e.g., "-alias server") that you used to generate your CSR. If you try to install the certificate to a different keystore or under a different alias, the import command will not work.

Run the command below to import the certificate into your keystore.

keytool -import -alias server -file your_site_name.p7b -keystore your_site_name.jks
In the command above, your_site_name.p7b should be the name of the certificate file you downloaded, your_site_name.jks should be the name of the keystore file you created in Step 1: Use Keytool to Create a New Keystore or when using the DigiCert Java Keytool CSR Wizard., and server should be the alias name you used when generating your CSR.

You should get a confirmation that the "Certificate reply was installed in keystore".

If you are prompted to trust the certificate, type y or yes.

The installation of this file loads all necessary certificates to your keystore.

Your keystore file (your_site_name.jks) is now ready to be used on your Tomcat Server. Now, you are ready to configure your server to use it.
